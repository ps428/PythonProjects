This includes understanding business processes and developing workflows that consider user experience and scalability. You'll be nimble as systems and workflows swiftly change.
Problem solver - You're able to research and resolve any problem that comes your way with recommendations or creative solutions, maintaining a people-first mindset. This could be system limitations (ATS), developing new workflows, troubleshooting bugs or issues and facilitating escalation or resources to resolve challenges.
Data literate - You'll work with cross-functional teams to maintain our systems in order to support data entry, access, integrity, and workflows and conduct regular audits. This could be job postings, requisitions, candidates, hires, headcount, etc. You're able to pull ad hoc reports and provide clean data and insights to partnering teams.
Systems experienced - You have experience in an operations role and have a passion for solving complex problems with both human and technical solutions. You balance user requirements, technical specs, and project timelines to support new projects and maintain existing tools/integrations.

You Have

About Barclays

Barclays is a British universal bank. We are diversified by business, by different types of customers and clients, and by geography. Our businesses include consumer banking and payments operations around the world, as well as a top-tier, full service, global corporate and investment bank, all of which are supported by our service company which provides technology, operations and functional services across the Group.

Risk and Control Objective

Ensure that all activities and duties are carried out in full compliance with regulatory requirements, Enterprise Wide Risk Management Framework and internal Barclays Policies and Policy Standards.

Working Flexibly

We’re committed to providing a supportive and inclusive culture and environment for you to work in.

If you would like some flexibility, then please discuss this with the hiring manager, and your request will be reviewed subject to business needs.

Hybrid Working

We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in.

Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances These requests will be reviewed and agreed for a period of time i.e., will have a start and end date.

Providing the opportunity for all our employees, globally to work flexibly empowers each of us to work in a way that suits our lives as well as enabling us to better service our customers’ and clients’ needs.

Hybrid Working<br>
<br>
We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in. We’re flexible on how this works and it may continue to change and evolve. Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances These requests will be reviewed and agreed for a period of time i.e., will have a start and end date.<br>
<br>
Please discuss the detail of the working pattern options for the role with the hiring manager.<br>
